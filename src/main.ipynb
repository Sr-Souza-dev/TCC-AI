O índice de impureza de Gini é uma medida de quão impura é a divisão das amostras em duas classes, e é usado em árvores de decisão para selecionar o melhor atributo para dividir os dados em subconjuntos mais homogêneos (Utilizado em bases de dados definidas para classificação com classes referênciadas em int).\n",
