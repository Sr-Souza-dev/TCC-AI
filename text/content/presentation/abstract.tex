\chapter*{Abstract}

\noindent This study proposes the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques to predict future stock values in the financial market. Initially, a historical and theoretical contextualization of the stock market is presented, addressing different analysis models used and highlighting the importance of forecasting time series. The main contribution of this work is the development of an Ensemble-based prediction machine. This machine takes multiple economic metrics as input and is capable of providing the probability of a specific financial asset exhibiting an upward or downward movement. Furthermore, initial experiments were conducted using three classification algorithms (SVM, KNN, and LR) on a dataset of PETR4 stocks. The results indicate that the KNN model achieved the best performance, followed by the proposed ensemble, while SVM showed similar results to the buy and hold strategy, and LR had inferior performance.
